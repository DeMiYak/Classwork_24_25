On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying: ''I am your uncle, and knew you from your likeness to mi brother. Go to your mother and tell her I am coming.``

Aladdin ran home, and told his mother of his newly found uncle.

''Indeed, child,`` she said, ''your father had a brother, but I always thought he was dead.``

However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and wruit. He presently fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin's mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been fotoy years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes, and took him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.
